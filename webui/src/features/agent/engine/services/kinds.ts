/**
 * Service layer (G1) — the vocabulary for "every capability is a service, each
 * independently BYOK or managed".
 *
 * A `ServiceKind` is a capability the agent can reach off-device. Each kind is
 * resolved (per request) to a `ServiceMode`:
 *   - "byok"    → call the provider directly with the USER's key,
 *   - "managed" → call our server proxy, which forwards with OUR keys (metered),
 *   - "keyless" → an explicitly selected provider that needs no key at all,
 *   - "off"     → unavailable (the corresponding tool is hidden).
 *
 * This module is pure types + constants — no React, no network — so the
 * resolution logic (`resolve.ts`) is trivially unit-testable.
